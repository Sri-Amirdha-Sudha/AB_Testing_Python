# A/B Testing with Python â€“ Analyzing Website Conversions

## Overview

This project applies A/B testing techniques using Python to analyze the performance of two versions of a website (Group A - Control, Group B - Treatment). The goal is to determine whether the new version improves conversion rates.

For a deeper understanding of A/B testing, check out my blog:

## Dataset  
The dataset used for this analysis is available on **Kaggle**:  [A/B Testing Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarsh0806/ab-testing-practice)

This dataset includes:

User ID â€“ Unique identifier for each user
Group â€“ Control (A) or Treatment (B)
Page Views â€“ Number of pages viewed per session
Time Spent â€“ Time spent on the website (in seconds)
Conversion â€“ Whether the user converted (Yes/No)
Device â€“ Desktop or Mobile
Location â€“ The userâ€™s country

## Whatâ€™s Inside?  
1. Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleaning and encoding categorical variables.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualizing conversion rates, time spent, and page views.
3. Hypothesis Testing â€“ Running Chi-Square, Mann-Whitney U Test to determine statistical significance.
4. Business Insights & Recommendations â€“ Interpreting findings to guide decision-making.

## Key Findings from A/B Testing

Group B (Treatment) had a significantly lower conversion rate than Group A.
Time Spent and Page Views showed no significant difference between the two groups.
Business Decision: The new version (Group B) underperformed, suggesting that changes to messaging, CTA, or design might have negatively impacted conversions.
